1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?

I chose to write this program in Python using a SQLite3 database to store the data.
Python is good for this excersize because it is a language I am comfortable with and it has very conviennent libraries for working with databases and HTTP requests.
I chose SQLite3 because it is a lightweight database that is easy to use and does not require a separate server to run.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

Ome major advantage of my solution is that it can be extended to work with any other database backend. 
Another advantage of my solution is that it that it uses SQLite3 to query the data, which allows for other programs to access the data for analysis.
One major disadvantage of my solution is that over time, the database would fill up with entries of companies with 0 points, which would make the database less efficient.
Another disadvantage of my solution is that allowing negative point values in the /add endpoint can lead to errors or negative point values for a payer.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
My favorite school project was one where I had to find a novel dataset and run some kind of statistical analysis on it.
For my project, I analyzed the relationship between student attendance for students who qualified for free or reduced lunch versus those who did not.
My favorite part of the project was finding the data and cleaning it up to be used in my analysis.
I also liked the process of working hands on with the various statistical tests we had learned in class and seeing them in action.
